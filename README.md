>Its pronoced Minecraft mods and dev. (some peaple call it Mc mods and dev, like mc donalds ðŸ™„)

This is a website for a project called MCMods&Dev, by visiting the actual website [here](https://skylerwilkinson.repl.co/) you can find its gist. Though I will sum up its purpose in this README.


## Its Purpose
MC mods and dev is supposed to:
1. Let peaple download mods off our site,
2. teach them how to make thier own, 
3. and be a place for paeple to share there projects.


## How it works (Technoligies)

This website is based on Html mixed with [Botstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and scss. There is [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/), but I dont know how to use it yet.
Though I would NOT like you to reach out to me, it would be quite fine for you to download and edit the code and make a pull request. 
> Im still larning to program, this is my first site. Knowing this do not be suprised if you find bad code in my project, I'd love to hear if you find anything.

This is made possible by minecraft itself.
actual mod making we use [Bridge](https://bridge-core.app) for minecraft bedrock
and [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/) for java.

## How to run it

-*hardware requirements*
>This website will run on almost all modern browsers that support css, html and javascript.

-*how to get to it*
>Currently the website is hosted a domain called [skylerwilkinson.repl.co](skylerwilkinson.repl.co), but we plan to change that.

>I am a minor and I havee to get off so I cant add anything more for now.
