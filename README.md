>Its pronoced Minecraft mods and dev. (some peaple call it Mc mods and dev, like mc donalds ðŸ™„)

This is a website for a project called MCMods&Dev, by visiting the actual website [here](https://skylerwilkinson.repl.co/) you can find its gist. Though I will sum up its purpose in this README.


## Its Purpose
MC mods and dev is supposed to:
1. Let peaple download mods off our site,
2. teach them how to make thier own, 
3. and be a place for paeple to share there projects.


## How it works (Technoligies)

This website is based on Html mixed with [Botstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and scss. There is [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/), but I dont know how to use it yet. For actual mod making we use [Bridge](https://bridge-core.app) for minecraft bedrock
and [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/) for java, and of course minecraft itself.

##### The code is bieng hosted on replit.com, though as the web devoloper of my company I want to edit purely on  [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). you might say, "Well you can just use both u dummy!" But thats not true, becuase I want to be able to test the code when ever I want, and the extensions that allow that need it to not be hosted in the first place, by somebody like replit.com. 
#### **Someone PLEASE help me with this.**


### Colaborations 

Though I would NOT like you to reach out to me, it would be quite fine for you to download and edit the code and make a pull request. 

## How to run it

-*hardware requirements*
>This website will run on almost all modern browsers that support css, html and javascript.

-*how to get to it*
>Currently the website is hosted a domain called [skylerwilkinson.repl.co](skylerwilkinson.repl.co), but we plan to change that.

>I am a minor and I havee to get off so I cant add anything more for now.
